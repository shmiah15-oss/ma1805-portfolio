Decided to make it cat themed, a inspired by both Halloween and the first realsitic computer animated animal in 1968 - Kitty (you said to have some artistic, cultural and technical - wasn't too sure what that meant)

Doing the code for the triangles was difficult - took me quite a while to do, I was going to do multiple cats but decided not to after fiddling with them
Is there a way to make the coners of the triangle curved?
(I got the hang of it now - I think)

Comments are really convieniant for organising

The background felt to plain as a solid colour, but I remembered seeing a project with a rainbow background using beginContour

I'm to much of a perfectionist for this
