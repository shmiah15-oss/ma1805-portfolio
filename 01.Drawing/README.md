Decided to make it cat themed, a reference to both Halloween and the first realsitic computer animated animal in 1968 - Kitty


Doing the code for the triangles is difficult - took me quite a while to do, i was going to do multiple cats but decided not to after fiddling with the triangles
Is there a way to make the coners of the triangle curved?
