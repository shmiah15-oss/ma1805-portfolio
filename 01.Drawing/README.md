This drawing was inspired by both Halloween and the first realsitic computer animated animal in 1968 - Kitty.

Doing the code for the triangles was difficult - took me quite a while to do, I was going to do multiple cats but decided not to after fiddling with them
Is there a way to make the coners of the triangle curved?

The background felt to plain as a solid colour, but I remembered seeing a project with a rainbow background using beginContour
